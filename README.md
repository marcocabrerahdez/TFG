## Machine Learning as an alternative to simulation models for decision making

> realizado en `Universidad de la Laguna`

## Resumen

There are many fields of application where it is common to use simulation to predict the long-term behavior of the modeled system. As the complexity of these models increases, so does the computational time required to obtain results. An alternative is to create a model with machine learning techniques that mimics the behavior of the original model, but whose computation time is almost instantaneous: these are called surrogate models. In this project, a comparison has been made between a simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of real-time continuous interstitial glucose monitoring systems for type 1 diabetes and surrogate machine learning models, analyzing performance metrics such as the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute percentage error. The results obtained have shown that surrogate models are able to accurately and efficiently capture the behavior of the modeled system in significantly less time, making them a valuable tool for real-time decision making applications.
